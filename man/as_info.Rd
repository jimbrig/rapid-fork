as_info(x, ...)
}

"terms_of_service". Extra names are ignored.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}
}
\value{
An \code{info} object as returned by \code{\link[=info]{info()}}.
}

\code{as_info()} turns an existing object into an \code{info} object. This is in
contrast with \code{\link[=info]{info()}}, which builds an \code{info} from individual properties.
