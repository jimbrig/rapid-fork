}
\value{
A \code{component_collection} S7 object with various schemas for the API.
}
\description{
Holds a set of reusable objects for different aspects of the OAS. All objects
defined within the components object will have no effect on the API unless
they are explicitly referenced from properties outside the components object.
We currently only support the security_schemes object within the components
object (see \code{\link[=security_scheme_collection]{security_scheme_collection()}}).
}
